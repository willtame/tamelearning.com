      <p>Welcome to Tame Learning. This site is currently under construction and will have new updates over the next few days.</p>
      <p>Our Assessment Framework is a cross-curricular tool which helps practitioners observe, document, and accelerate the ways students use language as a tool for learning in school.</p>
      <h2>Language Support</h2>
      <p>The assessment measures development in speaking, listening, reading and writing. It is a clear and functional tool for formative and summative assessment.</p>
      <p>We implement global strategies to ensure that language learners are supported in accessing the curriculum throughout their language-learning journey.</p>

    <p>An illustration is a visualisation that is created by an artist. It can be a drawing, a painting, a vector graphic, an interpretation, visual explanation of a text, concept or process, or a picture or photo that represents or clarifies something.</p>
