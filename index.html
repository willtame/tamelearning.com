    <p>The Assessment Framework is a cross-curricular tool which helps practitioners observe, document, and accelerate the ways students use language as a tool for learning in school.</p>
    <p>The assessment measures development in speaking, listening, reading and writing. It is a clear and functional tool for formative and summative assessment.</p>
    <h2>Language Support</h2>
    <p>It can inform teachers what level of language support pupils need and to guide differentiation in the classroom and display which language steps to focus on.</p>
    <p>We define language learners as any child for whom English is not their mother tongue. This covers a broad spectrum, from children who are just beginning their English Language Learning journey, to children for whom the second language English is so proficient.</p>
  </section>
  <p>We implement global strategies to ensure that language learners are supported in accessing the curriculum throughout their language-learning journey.</p>
