      <p>Welcome to Tame Learning. This site is currently under construction and will have new updates over the next few days.</p>
      <p>The Assessment Framework is a cross-curricular tool which helps practitioners observe, document, and accelerate the ways students use language as a tool for learning in school.</p>
      <p>The assessment measures development in speaking, listening, reading and writing. It is a clear and functional tool for formative and summative assessment.</p>
      <p>We implement global strategies to ensure that language learners are supported in accessing the curriculum throughout their language-learning journey.</p>
